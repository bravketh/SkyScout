SkyScout is a simple flight booking app  built in Java. It lets you search flights, compare results, and  pick seats through a clean and easy-to-use interface. Itâ€™s designed to show how booking systems work behind the scenes, using object-oriented programming, search/filter logic, and basic data handling.
